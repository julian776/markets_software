Please consider that this code only works on week because the data of markets is only available on weeks.

The program works with time.sleep() in many parts of code so the program take a wait to organize the data in the way the program need.

This program is in development.

This program is developed in group with Cristian Herrera.

If you only are interested in how it works run Prueba_worker_catalogador.py  (The function get_df() waits from 0 to 5 minutes)
